Simple Laplace Equation Solver

Before using, add your required boundary conditions to main.cpp

some potential applications include:
Electrostatics(finding Electric Potential in absence of charge), Heat Equation, Gravitation Potential


To use build using g++: ''' g++ -o run.out main.cpp '''
Then update run.sh to contain any new boundary conditions desired and finally run the bash script in the terminal
